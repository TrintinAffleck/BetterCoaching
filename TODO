Fix positive % ratio
When I use mouse button to go back the message is not read in inbox
Probably could cleanup a lot of views by adding code into utils.py
Implement updateCoach view
Need to fix inbox to be able to send messages and only send them to coaches
Add unread messages to the nav bar if there is a new message
Fix the dates in inbox its not the right date its like 7 hours ahead
When I add a coach is_coach is not being set after the Coach is created
